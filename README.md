# E-Commerce

## Description

This is a database for an non-deployed E-Commerce application. The application does not have a frontend and all of its contents are present on the backend using MySQL and Sequelize. 
The data in the database consists of information on products and the categories each product belongs to. Each product also has information about the name of product, 
price, stock number, as well as related products if applicable. The database also gives information on the tags associated with the products. The database also allows users to view
all of a single product(s), categorie(s), and tag(s). This database allows for users to create, update, or delete products, categories, and tags.
